gc_app - 
A Ruby based application to automate gathering baseball game data from an online
service for youth/prep baseball teams.

Combining my interest in youth sports and a desire to learn more about automated web testing
and web scraping, the gc_app was born.

This app solves two short falls:
1) Allows reconstructing Game play by play data in true chronological (oldest to newest)
order.
2) Allows generation of game stats not supported in typical baseball stat sites.

This tool is based on the following technologies:
- Ruby
- the Nokogiri Ruby gem for parsing HTML data
- the Watir Ruby Gem, an implementation of the Selenium API for automated web site testing,
  this is used for navigation of web sites
- JSON parsing
  
The application itself is quite small, at around 1200 lines of commented Ruby code.  It 
does all the web navigation of of team, player, and game pages from the GC site (pretty
cool to watch the pages fly by), and gathers key data as it navigates and finally produces
an xml file.  This xml file can be opened with any browser and specific data can be 
inspected.  A future project will provide a nicer presentation of that data.
